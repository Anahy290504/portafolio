## Work Experience
**Data Science Consultant at Constructor | Best Secret Data Scientist (_November 2024_)**
- Collaborated with the Best Secret Data Science team to develop a CatBoost-based machine learning model to optimize packaging in e-commerce logistics.
- Engineered new product features, improving model accuracy from 0.5 to 0.7.
- Provided recommendations for collecting more relevant data, further enhancing model performance

**Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Leipzig and ScaDS.AI Dresden/Leipzig (_May 2023 - June 2024_)**
- Advanced the theoretical foundations of the Consensus Segmentation problem by analyzing potential properties and their impact on segmentation solutions.
- Disproved a conjecture from the paper Weighted Consensus Segmentations (Computation, 2021; 9(2):17, DOI: 10.3390/computation9020017).

**Postdoctoral Researche at University of Leipzig and Mewedo (_February 2022 - April 2023_)**
- Designed a model to assess student skills and match candidates to job offers, collaborating with cross-disciplinary experts.
- Developed a tailored proficiency metric based on five factors, delivering more accurate job fit assessments.
- Outperformed standard evaluations by capturing job-specific competencies and providing deeper insights into candidate suitability

**Postdoctoral Researcher at  University of Leipzig (_November 2019 - October 2021_)**
- Designed an algorithm to find Hamiltonian cycles (tours) in power graphs, with applications in network optimization and graph-based machine learning models.
- Defined and explored the properties of a connectivity concept for directed hypergraphs, with applications in network analysis and multi-relational data modeling
